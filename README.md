# emotion_classifier_model
This model classifies emotions from text using Logistic Regression. It preprocesses text (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal) and converts it into numerical form using TF-IDF Vectorization. Trained on labeled data, it predicts emotions with an accuracy of ~71%. The model is saved and deployed via Streamlit for real-time usage.
